# 🎂 Age Calculator App

A simple and convenient web application for accurately calculating the user's age in years, months, and days.

## 🚀 About the project

This project was created to practice working with the `Date` object in JavaScript and implementing algorithms for calculating time intervals. The application takes into account the different number of days in months and leap years.

### Main features:
* **Accurate calculation:** Calculates age down to the day.
* **Data validation:** Checks that the date is not in the future or too old (before 1800).
* **“Borrowing” algorithm:** Correctly handles cases where the current day or month is less than the birthday, avoiding negative values.
